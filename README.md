Addons to create music with openFrameworks: make a studio with code!

DStudio combines the ofSoundStream class of openFrameworks with the DSP library DaisySP from Electro-smith. 

DStudio provides another abstraction layer where you don't deal with soundstreams and filters but with synthesizers, mixers, plugins and sequencers. 

Like making a studio with code!

The parts of DStudio are:
* ofxDaisySP – an addon with DaisySP, a DSP library.
* ofxDStudio – an addon which builds upon DaisySP to give you synthesizers, a sample player, drum sounds, FX plugins, a mixer with FX, sequencers as well as utilities. All can be controlled by MIDI.
* demos – nine examples that shows you how to use DStudio.

In ofxDStudio you will find:
* 3 synthesizer classes
* 1 sample player class
* 6 drum classes
* 1 mixer class
* 1 splitter class
* 2 sequencer classes
* 6 FX classes
* a total of 24 classes

DStudio comes with aan extensive written manual.

Files will soon be added here.

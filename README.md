# ofxDStudio
An addon that together with ofxDaisySP can be used to create music with openFrameworks: make a studio with code!

DStudio combines the ofSoundStream class of openFrameworks with the DSP library DaisySP from Electro-smith. 

DStudio provides another abstraction layer where you don't deal with soundstreams and filters but with synthesizers, mixers, plugins and sequencers. 

Like making a studio with code!
